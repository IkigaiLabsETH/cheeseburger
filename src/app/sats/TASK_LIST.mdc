# Sats Page Implementation

A Bitcoin Lightning-powered photography platform where users can support creators with micropayments. Every like sends sats directly to photographers.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up basic page structure with Next.js 14
- [x] Create responsive hero section with Framer Motion animations
- [x] Implement features grid with card components
- [x] Build photo grid component with hover effects
- [x] Add Lightning Network integration service
- [x] Configure image optimization for Unsplash photos
- [x] Set up proper client/server component boundaries
- [x] Add loading states and skeleton UI
- [x] Implement error handling for Lightning payments
- [x] Configure proper Next.js image domains and patterns
- [x] Fix server component serialization issues
- [x] Optimize Framer Motion imports for better performance

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Add proper error tracking service integration (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Implement analytics to track user interactions and payments
- [ ] Add rate limiting for Lightning payment attempts

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add user authentication system
- [ ] Implement photographer profiles and portfolios
- [ ] Create dashboard for photographers to track earnings
- [ ] Add image upload functionality for photographers
- [ ] Implement webhook handling for Lightning payment confirmations
- [ ] Add automated testing suite
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement proper SEO optimization
- [ ] Add proper logging system
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement content moderation system
- [ ] Add proper security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create documentation for photographers and users

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture

- Next.js 14 with App Router for the frontend
- Lightning Network for payments
- Framer Motion for animations
- Shadcn UI + Tailwind for styling
- SWR for data fetching (to be implemented)
- Redis for rate limiting (to be implemented)

### Data Flow

1. User views photo grid
2. On like/support:
   - Check Lightning wallet connection
   - Initiate payment
   - Show loading state
   - Handle success/failure
   - Update UI accordingly

### Technical Requirements for Production

1. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add error tracking service
   - Create user-friendly error messages

2. Performance:
   - Optimize image loading
   - Implement proper caching
   - Add performance monitoring

3. Security:
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Set up security headers
   - Add input validation

4. Monitoring:
   - Set up logging
   - Add performance metrics
   - Create alerting system
