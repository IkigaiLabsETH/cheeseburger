## Leveraging OnchainKit

[OnchainKit](https://github.com/coinbase/onchainkit) is an open-source toolkit by Coinbase that provides React components and TypeScript utilities to help you build robust, user-friendly onchain applications. It is designed to accelerate development and ensure best practices for web3 and onchain integrations.

### What is OnchainKit?
- A library of reusable React UI components and TypeScript utilities for onchain/web3 apps.
- Includes wallet connection, transaction signing, and blockchain data utilities.
- Built and maintained by Coinbase, with a focus on security, UX, and developer experience.

### Why Use OnchainKit?
- **Faster Development:** Prebuilt, customizable components for wallet connect, transaction flows, and more.
- **Security:** Audited, production-grade code maintained by Coinbase.
- **UX Best Practices:** Consistent, accessible UI patterns for onchain actions.
- **TypeScript Support:** Strong typing and utilities for safer, more reliable code.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Coinbase APIs and other EVM-compatible chains.

### How to Leverage OnchainKit in This Integration
1. **Install OnchainKit:**
   ```bash
   npm install @coinbase/onchainkit
   # or
   yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit
   ```
2. **Use Components:**
   - Integrate wallet connection, transaction, and notification components into your Coinbase subpage or flows.
   - Example: Add a wallet connect button to let users link their wallets before onramp/offramp actions.
   ```tsx
   import { WalletConnectButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit';

   function MyComponent() {
     return <WalletConnectButton />;
   }
   ```
3. **Leverage Utilities:**
   - Use TypeScript helpers for transaction building, address validation, and more.
   - Integrate with Coinbase Onramp/Offramp API flows for a seamless user experience.
4. **Customization:**
   - Style components with Tailwind or your design system.
   - Extend or compose OnchainKit components as needed.

## Why Integrate Coinbase Onramp/Offramp?

- **User Experience:** Allow users to buy and sell crypto directly from our platform.
- **Compliance:** Leverage Coinbase's KYC/AML and regulatory coverage.
- **Security:** Rely on Coinbase's secure custody and transaction infrastructure.
- **Coverage:** Access a wide range of fiat currencies and payment methods.

---

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Obtain API Credentials
- Sign up for a Coinbase Cloud account.
- Create an Onramp/Offramp API project.
- Obtain your API key and secret from the [Coinbase Cloud Console](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/getting-started).

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env.local`:
```env
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
COINBASE_ONRAMP_BASE_URL=https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/v1
COINBASE_OFFRAMP_BASE_URL=https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/offramp/v1
```
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control.

### 3. Install Required Packages
- Use `axios` or `fetch` for HTTP requests.
- Use `zod` for type validation.

---

## Features

- **Onramp:** Let users buy crypto with fiat (ACH, cards, etc.).
- **Offramp:** Let users sell crypto for fiat and withdraw to bank accounts.
- **KYC/AML:** User onboarding and verification handled by Coinbase.
- **Webhooks:** Listen for transaction status updates.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of API/network errors.

---

## API Reference

### Onramp Endpoints
- `POST /onramp/sessions` — Create a new onramp session.
- `GET /onramp/sessions/{id}` — Get session status.

### Offramp Endpoints
- `POST /offramp/sessions` — Create a new offramp session.
- `GET /offramp/sessions/{id}` — Get session status.

See [Coinbase Onramp API Docs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/getting-started) and [Offramp API Overview](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp/docs/api-offramp-overview) for full details.

---

## Implementation Details

- **API Client:** Centralized client for all Coinbase API calls.
- **Session Management:** Store and track user sessions for onramp/offramp flows.
- **Webhooks:** Implement endpoint to receive transaction updates.
- **Type Safety:** Use Zod schemas for request/response validation.
- **UI Integration:** Embed Coinbase's hosted widget or build custom UI using API.

---

## Error Handling & Fixes

- Handle API errors (4xx, 5xx) with user-friendly messages.
- Implement retry logic for network failures.
- Log errors for monitoring and debugging.

---

## Security & Compliance

- Store API keys securely (never in client code).
- Use HTTPS for all API calls.
- Follow Coinbase's compliance requirements for user data.

---

## Testing & Monitoring

- Write unit/integration tests for API client and webhooks.
- Monitor API usage and error rates.
- Use mock data for local development.

---

## Potential Enhancements

- Add support for additional payment methods.
- Localize UI for different regions.
- Integrate with analytics for conversion tracking.
